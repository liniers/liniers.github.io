		// but the range is really big and the younger people would be too small
		// so start with a minimum size and proportion out the rest to a maximum size

		// we need the minimum age and the maximum age
		// we can eyeball it with this data (16, 58), 
		// but one way to code it is to add all ages to a single array
		// then sort the single array by number and take the first and last entry

				// multiply the force by some factor that seems right...
				circle.force((stageW/2-circle.x)*.1, (stageH/2-circle.y)*.1);
